<p>As an intern at Wunderwell, I constructed a database of thousands of practitioners in the Washington, D.C. area using the Yelp API and Python. I then was able to build a search engine to display the results to customers. This helped to inform partnership and expansion decisions by management. This script can be used to build a database of businesses across the world!</p>
