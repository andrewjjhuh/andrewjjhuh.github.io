<h1><a href="#">Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</a></h1>
<p>As a product engineer for the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, I designed and constructed a 15-piece childrenâ€™s play set for the Preschool Language Scales 5th Edition to assist a speech language pathologist in administering assessment to children with communicative and motor impairments. My team was able to incorporate feedback from clients and users to constantly improve our product and fulfill our user's needs.</p>
